     "Shadow Prices of Non-performing Loans and Technical Efficiency for Chinese Banks
     over 2007–2014,"</A>
     <CITE>Journal of Applied Finance & Banking</CITE> forthcoming (2020)
     <P><BLOCKQUOTE>
     This paper examines how non-performing loans (NPLs) affect Chinese commercial banks before, during, and 
     after the 2008 global financial crisis as well as the subsequent 2008--2010 stimulus. The directional 
     output distance function is used to estimate the technical efficiency while accounting for NPLs as 
     undesirable outputs. I then employ the envelop theorem to calculate the shadow price of NPLs. 
     The shadow price of NPLs is the opportunity cost of reducing NPLs by one unit. Empirical results 
     show that the four major state-owned banks are the least technically efficient while foreign banks 
     are the most efficient. I also find that the crisis has a negative effect on banks' technical 
     efficiency while the stimulus initially has a positive effect on four major state-owned commercial banks 
     and joint-stock commercial banks, but later shows a negative effect with a higher default ratio and 
     lower efficiency. Finally, the data show that the stimulus has greatly increased the shadow price of 
     NPLs for four major state-owned commercial banks. Starting in 2011, the shadow prices of NPLs for four 
     major state-owned commercial banks are much higher than all other bank types.

    This paper examines the performance of Chinese commercial banks before, during, and after the 2008 
    global financial crisis and the 2008--2010 China's 4 trillion Renminbi stimulus plan. Fully 
    nonparametric methods are used to estimate technical efficiencies. Recently-developed statistical 
    results are used to test for changes in efficiencies as well as productivity over time, and to test 
    for changes in technology over time. We also test for differences in efficiency and productivity 
    between big and small banks, and between domestic and foreign banks. We find evidence of the 
    non-convexity of banks' production set. The data reveal that technical efficiency declined at 
    the start of the global financial crisis (2007--2008) and after the China's stimulus plan (2010--2011), 
    but recovered in the years later (2011--2013), and declined again from 2013 to 2014, ending lower 
    in 2014 than in 2007. We find that productivity declined during and just after the China's stimulus 
    plan (2009--2011), but recovered in the years later (2013--2014), ending lower in 2014 than in 2007. 
    We also find that the technology shifted downward from 2012 to 2013, and then shifted upward from 2013 
    to 2014. Over the period 2007--2014, technology shifted upward. We provide evidence that in general 
    big banks were more efficient and productive than small banks. Finally, domestic banks had higher 
    efficiency and productivity than foreign banks over this period except in 2008.

    "Performance of Countries in the Post-Crisis Era,"</A>
    <CITE>Working Paper</CITE> (co-authored with Paul Wilson).
    <P><BLOCKQUOTE>

    This paper examines the performance of 144 countries in the world before, during, and after the 
    2007--2012 global financial crisis. Fully nonparametric methods are used to estimate technical 
    efficiencies. Recently-developed statistical results are used to test for changes in efficiencies 
    as well as productivity over time, and to test for changes in technology over time. We also test 
    for these differences between developing and developed countries. Evidence of the non-convexity of 
    countries' production set is found. The data revealed that technical efficiency continued increasing 
    before the global financial crisis (2006--2008), but declined in the years later (2010--2014), ending 
    the same in 2014 as in 2004. We also find that mean productivity continued decreasing from 2004 to 2010. 
    Moreover, productivity in 2004 stochastic dominants in the first order that in 2014. Statistical tests 
    indicate that the frontier continued shifting downward from 2004 to 2010, and then continued shifting 
    upward from 2010 to 2014. Overall, the technology has shifted downward from 2004 to 2014. Finally, we 
    provide evidence that developing economies have lower technical efficiency but higher productivity 
    than developed economies for each year. Finally, we provide evidence that there exists convergence 
    in productivity between developing and developed economies.

    "Evidence from Shadow Price of Equity on "Too-Big-to-Fail","</A>

    This paper uses a new measure, the shadow price of equity, to test the existence of ``Too-Big-to-Fail'' 
    (TBTF) banks in the U.S. over 2001--2018. I use nonparametric least squares methods for stochastic 
    frontier models initially developed by Simar  et  al.  (2017) to estimate the cost function for U.S. 
    commercial banks and thereby derive the shadow price of equity. Evidence on the existence of TBTF banks 
    are found. Specifically, I find that a negative correlation exists between the shadow 
    price of equity and the size of banks in each year, suggesting that big banks pay less in equity than 
    small banks. In addition, in each year there are more banks with a negative shadow price of 
    equity in the fourth quartile based on total assets than in the other three quartiles. The data also 
    reveal that for each year, the estimated mean shadow price of equity for the top 100 
    largest banks is smaller than the mean price of deposits, even though equity is commonly viewed 
    as a riskier asset than deposits. Finally, I find that the top 10 largest banks are willing to pay 
    much more at the start of the global financial crisis and after the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 
    Consumer Protection Act of 2010. These results imply that the regulations are effective in reducing the 
    implicit subsidy, at least for the top 10 largest banks. However, it is also evident that the 
    recapitalization has imposed significant equity funding costs for the top $10$ largest banks.

     "The Shadow Prices of CO2, SO2 and NOx for U.S. Coal Power Industry 2010–2018:
     A Convex Quantile Regression Method,"</A>
     <CITE>Working Paper</CITE>.
     <P><BLOCKQUOTE>
     Evaluating shadow prices is critical in devising environmental regulatory policies for CO2, SO2, and NOx.  
     Compared to traditional frontier estimation methods, this paperuses a novel data-driven approach based on 
     convex quantile regression, taking the noiseand inefficiency into account and estimating the shadow prices 
     locally.  We apply thismethod to jointly estimate shadow prices of CO2, SO2, and NOx produced by U.S. coal 
     power plants from 2010 to 2018.  During this period, five major regulatory provisions were implemented to 
     U.S. coal power plants.  We find that the shadow prices of CO2,SO2, and NOx increased from 2010 to 2018.  
     The increase in shadow price for CO2ismainly due to the increase in electricity price, while the increase 
     in shadow prices for SO2 and NOx are mainly due to the successful emission reductions. This indicates that 
     the government on-going regulations are successful in reducing pollutants emissions. However, 
     the relatively lower market allowance prices compared to the shadow pricesindicate that the society could 
     benefit more if the government further decreases thetotal budget for SO2and NOx.
