     "Quantile Estimation of Stochastic Frontier Models with the Normal-Half Normal Specification: A Cumulative Distribution Function Approach,"</A>
     <CITE>Economics Letters, forthcoming</CITE> (2021)
     <P><BLOCKQUOTE>
    In this paper, based on the cumulative distribution function (CDF) method (Jradi
    et al., 2021) for finding the optimal quantile when estimating stochastic frontier models
    (SFM) with normal-exponential composite error term, we derive an expression to find
    the optimal quantile for the SFM with normal-half normal composite error term. We
    then use Monte-Carlo simulations and the same data set as Jradi et al. (2019) to
    compare the difference of iteration method (Jradi et al., 2019) and CDF method for the
    SFM with normal-half normal specification. The simulations and empirical application
    illustrate that both methods work well.

     "Shadow Prices of Non-performing Loans and Technical Efficiency for Chinese Banks
     over 2007–2014,"</A>
     <CITE>Journal of Applied Finance & Banking</CITE> (2020)
     <P><BLOCKQUOTE>
     This paper examines how non-performing loans (NPLs) affect Chinese commercial banks before, during, and 
     after the 2008 global financial crisis as well as the subsequent 2008--2010 stimulus. The directional 
     output distance function is used to estimate the technical efficiency while accounting for NPLs as 
     undesirable outputs. I then employ the envelop theorem to calculate the shadow price of NPLs. 
     The shadow price of NPLs is the opportunity cost of reducing NPLs by one unit. Empirical results 
     show that the four major state-owned banks are the least technically efficient while foreign banks 
     are the most efficient. I also find that the crisis has a negative effect on banks' technical 
     efficiency while the stimulus initially has a positive effect on four major state-owned commercial banks 
     and joint-stock commercial banks, but later shows a negative effect with a higher default ratio and 
     lower efficiency. Finally, the data show that the stimulus has greatly increased the shadow price of 
     NPLs for four major state-owned commercial banks. Starting in 2011, the shadow prices of NPLs for four 
     major state-owned commercial banks are much higher than all other bank types.

    "Evidence from Shadow Price of Equity on "Too-Big-to-Fail","</A>
    <CITE>Under Review</CITE> 
    <P><BLOCKQUOTE>

    This paper estimates the shadow price of equity for U.S.~commercial
    banks over 2001--2018 using nonparametric local-linear estimators of the
    underlying cost frontier and tests the existence of ``Too-Big-to-Fail''
    (TBTF) banks. Evidence for the existence of TBTF banks is found.
    We find that a negative correlation exists between the
    shadow price of equity and the size of banks in each year, suggesting
    that big banks pay less for equity than small banks. In addition, in each
    year there are more banks with a negative shadow price of equity in the
    fourth quartile based on total assets than in the other three quartiles.
    The data also reveal that for each year, the estimated mean shadow price
    of equity for the 50 largest banks is smaller than the mean price
    of deposits, even though equity is commonly viewed as a riskier asset
    than deposits. Finally, we find that the top 10 largest banks are
    willing to pay much more at the start of the global financial crisis and
    after the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of
    2010 than the other periods. These results imply that these regulations
    are effective in reducing the implicit subsidy, at least for the top
    10 largest banks. However, it is also evident that the
    recapitalization has imposed significant equity funding costs for the
    top 10 largest banks.
